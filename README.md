# BF_compress
Uses BF to compresses a BF script so it only has the eight needed commands
To run, find a BF interpreter and input the desired code to be compressed.  The output is the compressed version as a single line.

The current version does not account for bad user syntax, a "[" at the very beginning with no matching "]" will cause the script to fail.
